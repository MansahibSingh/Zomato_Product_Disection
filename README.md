This case study presents a comprehensive analysis of Zomato, a leading food-tech platform, focusing on how it addresses real-world problems through innovative features and services. The study explores Zomato’s core offerings—such as restaurant discovery, food delivery, user reviews, and personalized recommendations—and how these elements work together to solve challenges like busy lifestyles, food waste, dietary restrictions, and hygiene concerns.

The case study is divided into the following sections:

 * Product Dissection: Breaks down Zomato’s features and how they align with user needs.

 * Problem-Solution Mapping: Identifies key real-world challenges and maps them to Zomato’s solutions.

 * Schema Design: Defines the data structure behind Zomato's platform, with detailed entity descriptions (e.g., Users, Restaurants, Orders, Reviews, etc.).

 * Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): Visual representation of the relationships among different entities in the schema.

 * Use Case Relationships: Explains how different actors (users, restaurants, delivery agents) interact within the platform ecosystem.

This project provides insights into how technology, data, and user experience come together to build scalable, socially responsible digital products. Ideal for those exploring data modeling, product analysis, or aspiring to work in the food-tech or data analytics domain.
